## Assignment

Create an innovative, experimantal, yet pleasurable user experience by using CSS and SVG. No Javascript allowed.

Pick atleast one contexts and try to use some restrictions

## Add _one_ contexts

You have to add at least one extra context to your site

- [ ] print-stylesheet
- [X] prefers-reduced-motion
- [X] dark-mode
- [ ] input type (pointer)
- [ ] <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Media_Queries/Using_media_queries">pick a better one</a>

### My pick

I picked dark mode to add as a context. My design corresponds to your preferred device light or dark mode. I also build in a switch to be able to toggle between them.

## Pick a restriction(s)

Choose restriction(s)

- [ ] When SVG meets CSS: Shapes / Masks / SVG
- [ ] Two colours
- [ ] Less than 5kb CSS *(not as an excuses for lazyness, hahaha)*
- [ ] No squares, no rectangles, no circles, no triangles
- [ ] Design must be visually appealing and it must meet <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/#guidelines">Level AAA conformance</a> of the WCAG.
- [ ] Solar powered website
- [X] Responsive without media queries
- [ ] Design responds to weather/time
- [ ] Design responds to connectivity
- [ ] Design responds to battery level
- [ ] Design responds to language setting
- [ ] Design responding language setting / Japanese / English / Greek / Mongolian
- [ ] Create a great experience only with pop-ups, advertising banners and carousels!

### My picks

* I picked responsiveness without media queries because I've never done this before and was ready for a challenge. I used flex for this.

* I also picked reduce motion because my website has a lot of animations. This way, people who want reduce motions will still be able to see my website.

## Some experiments

* [Simple checkbox hack](https://codepen.io/StefanGerrits/pen/BaNaGYW)
* [Target property](https://codepen.io/StefanGerrits/pen/xxGxQMv)
* [Splash animation with checkboxes](https://vizhub.com/StefanGerrits2/b167caa7051e46c9a7642a634574c39b?edit=files&file=index.html)
